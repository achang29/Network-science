Overall look at the student who has at least one good grade, which is grade A or grade B, in three subjects


Code:
Match (t:TestGrade)<-[:GET_GRADE]-(s:StudentInfo)
Match (p:ParentalLevelOfEducation)<-[:HAS_PARENTS_BACKGROUND]-(s:StudentInfo)-[:CLASSIFIED_AS]->(g:Race)
Where (t.reading_grade = 'A' or t.reading_grade = 'B'or t.math_grade = 'A' or t.math_grade = 'B' or t.writing_grade = 'A' or t.writing = 'B') 
Return t.reading_grade as good_reading_grade,t.math_grade as good_math_grade,t.writing_grade as good_writing_grade, s.lunch as lunch_status, s.test_preparation_course as test_preparation_course , s.gender as gender, g.group as race, p.level as parental_level_of_edu


a.	Count how many female students who have good performance,

Match (t:TestGrade)<-[:GET_GRADE]-(s:StudentInfo)
Where (t.reading_grade = 'A' or t.reading_grade = 'B'or t.math_grade = 'A' or t.math_grade = 'B' or t.writing_grade = 'A' or t.writing = 'B') AND (s.gender = 'female')
Return count(s.gender) as count_female_goodgrade

b.	Count how many students whose lunch status is standard,

Match (t:TestGrade)<-[:GET_GRADE]-(s:StudentInfo)
Where (t.reading_grade = 'A' or t.reading_grade = 'B'or t.math_grade = 'A' or t.math_grade = 'B' or t.writing_grade = 'A' or t.writing = 'B') AND (s.lunch = 'standard')
Return count(s.lunch) as count_lunch_standard_goodgrade

c.	Count how many studentsâ€™ parents are higher educated,

Match (t:TestGrade)<-[:GET_GRADE]-(s:StudentInfo)
Match (p:ParentalLevelOfEducation)<-[:HAS_PARENTS_BACKGROUND]-(s:StudentInfo)
Where (t.reading_grade = 'A' or t.reading_grade = 'B'or t.math_grade = 'A' or t.math_grade = 'B' or t.writing_grade = 'A' or t.writing = 'B') AND (p.level = "master's degree" or p.level = "bachelor's degree")
Return count(p.level) as count_higheredu_goodgrade

Another insight for looking at how many student have low performance, which is grade D or F,  on each test grade. By looking at each subject, we can know if the school have to work more on which subject in order to make students get improvement.
Code

a.	Low performance on math
Match (t:TestGrade)<-[:GET_GRADE]-(s:StudentInfo)
Where (t.math_grade = 'D'or t.math_grade = 'F') 
Return count(s.student_id) as bad_math_grade


b.	Low performance on writing

Code
Match (t:TestGrade)<-[:GET_GRADE]-(s:StudentInfo)
Where (t.writing_grade = 'D'or t.writing_grade = 'F') 
Return count(s.student_id) as bad_writing_grade


c.	Low performance on reading

Code
Match (t:TestGrade)<-[:GET_GRADE]-(s:StudentInfo)
Where (t.reading_grade = 'D'or t.reading_grade = 'F') 
Return count(s.student_id) as bad_reading_grade
